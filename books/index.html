			<h1>Books</h1>
			<p>Growing up, I never was a big of reading books. Somewhat recently, I had an epiphany on the value of reading and decided that this was a worthwhile pursuit. The initial selection of books I have read so far have not disappointed. Below is a list of books I have read/will read some time in the near future. If you have any recommendations, feel free to let me know. </p>
